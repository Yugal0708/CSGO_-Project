🎮 CS:GO Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting round-level outcomes in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook and is intended for educational and analytical purposes.

📌 Project Objectives

Analyze CS:GO round snapshot data

Understand the impact of in-game parameters on round outcomes

Apply multiple machine learning classification algorithms

Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics

📊 Dataset Information

The project uses a CS:GO round-level dataset containing detailed match statistics such as team economy, weapons, and round conditions.

Note:
The original dataset used during experimentation was not preserved.
For reproducibility, any publicly available CS:GO Round Snapshots dataset with similar features can be used.
Update the dataset path in the notebook accordingly.
